# ADIOS2-Examples GrayScott.jl

Julia version of [the gray-scott C++ and Python](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2-Examples/blob/master/source/cpp/gray-scott/)
example. 

This is a 3D 7-point stencil code to simulate the following [Gray-Scott
reaction diffusion model](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.261.5118.189):

```
u_t = Du * (u_xx + u_yy + u_zz) - u * v^2 + F * (1 - u) + noise * randn(-1,1)
v_t = Dv * (v_xx + v_yy + v_zz) + u * v^2 - (F + k) * v
```

This version contains: 

- CPU threaded solver using Julia's [multithreading]](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/)
- GPU solvers using [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl), [AMDGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl)
- Parallel I/O using the [ADIOS2.jl](https://github.com/eschnett/ADIOS2.jl) Julia bindings to [ADIOS2](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2)
- Message passing interface (MPI) using [MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl) Julia bindings to MPI
- Easily switch between float- (Float32) and double- (Float64) precision in the configuration file

## How to run

Currently only the simulation part is ported from C++, the PDFcalc data analysis is work-in-progress. 

Pre-requisities:

- A recent Julia version: v1.9.0 as of May 2023 from [julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

### Run locally 

1. **Set up dependencies**

From the `GrayScott.jl` directory instantiate and use MPI artifact jll (preferred method). 
To use a system provided MPI, see [here](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/latest/configuration/#using_system_mpi)

```julia

$ julia --project

Julia REPL

julia> ]  

(GrayScott.jl)> instantiate
...
(GrayScott.jl)> <-
julia> using MPIPreferences
julia> MPIPreferences.use_jll_binary()
julia> exit()
```

Julia manages its own packages using [Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/), the above would create platform-specific `LocalPreferences.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.

To use a system provided ADIOS2 library, see [here](https://eschnett.github.io/ADIOS2.jl/dev/#Using-a-custom-or-system-provided-ADIOS2-library). 
It just sets the environment variable `JULIA_ADIOS2_PATH` and build ADIOS2.jl in Julia.

**Note**: GrayScott.jl requires the `main` development version.

    ```
    $ julia
    julia> ]
    GrayScott.jl> add ADIOS2#main  
    ```

2. **Set up the examples/settings-files.json configuration file**

```
{
    "L": 64,
    "Du": 0.2,
    "Dv": 0.1,
    "F": 0.02,
    "k": 0.048,
    "dt": 1.0,
    "plotgap": 10,
    "steps": 1000,
    "noise": 0.1,
    "output": "gs-julia-1MPI-64L-F32.bp",
    "checkpoint": false,
    "checkpoint_freq": 700,
    "checkpoint_output": "ckpt.bp",
    "restart": false,
    "restart_input": "ckpt.bp",
    "adios_config": "adios2.xml",
    "adios_span": false,
    "adios_memory_selection": false,
    "mesh_type": "image",
    "precision": "Float32",
    "backend": "CPU"
}
```

The file is nearly identical to the C++ original example. 
Not all options are currently supported, but two Julia-only options are added: 

    - "precision": either Float32 or Float64 in the array simulation (including GPUs)
    - "backend": "CPU", "CUDA" or "AMDGPU"


3. **Running the simulation**

- `CPU threads`: launch julia assigning a number of threads (e.g. -t 8):

    ```
    $ julia --project -t 8 gray-scott.jl examples/settings-files.json
    ```

- `CUDA/AMDGPU`: set the "backend" option in examples/settings-files.json to either "CUDA" or "AMDGPU"

    ```
    $ julia --project gray-scott.jl examples/settings-files.json
    ```

This would generate an adios2 file from the output entry in the configuration file (e.g. `gs-julia-1MPI-64L-F32.bp`)
that can be visualized with ParaView with either the VTX or the FIDES readers.
**Important**: the AMDGPU.jl implementation of `randn` is currently work in progress. 
See related issue [here](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl/issues/378)


4. **Running on OLCF Summit and Crusher systems**
The code was tested on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facilities (OLCF): [Summit](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/summit_user_guide.html) and [Crusher](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/crusher_quick_start_guide.html). Both are used testing a recent version of Julia [v1.9.0-beta3](https://julialang.org/downloads/#upcoming_release) and a `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` is required to install packages and artifacts. **DO NOT USE your home directory**. We are providing configuration scripts in `scripts/config_XXX.sh` showing the plumming required for these systems. They need to be executed only once per session from the login nodes. 

To reuse these file the first 3 entries must be modified and run on login-nodes and the PATH poiting at a downloaded Julia binary for the corresponding PowerPC (Summit) and x86-64 (Crusher) architectures. Only "CPU" and "CUDA" backends are supported on Summit, while "CPU" and "AMDGPU" backends are supported on Crusher.

    ```
    # Replace these 3 entries
    PROJ_DIR=/gpfs/alpine/proj-shared/csc383
    export JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=$PROJ_DIR/etc/summit/julia_depot
    GS_DIR=$PROJ_DIR/wgodoy/ADIOS2-Examples/source/julia/GrayScott.jl
    ...
    # and the path 
    export PATH=$PROJ_DIR/opt/summit/julia-1.9.0-beta3/bin:$PATH
    ```

## To-do list

  1. Add support including random number on device kernel code on `AMDGPU.jl`
  2. Set the domain size `L` in the configuration file as a multiple of 6 for Summit, and a multiple of 4 on Crusher
  3. Add data analysis: PDF for u and v and Julia 2D plotting capabilities: Plots.jl, Makie.jl
  4. Add interactive computing with Pluto.jl notebooks
